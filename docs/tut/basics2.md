# Scala basics 2

In this session we'll deepen our knowledge of pattern matching &
recursion!

# Pattern matching

Pattern matching is a technique used in scala (and other languages) to
compare values against shapes and conditions.  You can think of it
like a more powerful `switch` statement.

# Pattern matching

```tut:silent
val a: Int = 3

a match {
  case 3 => "it's three!"
  case _ => "it's not three!"
}
```

# Exhaustivity

Scala's pattern matching has an exhaustivity checker.  This means
that the compiler will warn if we forget to match against one of the
cases.

```tut:silent
sealed trait Color
case object Blue extends Color
case object Red extends Color
case object Green extends Color
case class Other(name: String) extends Color
```

# Exhaustivity

```tut
val color: Color = Blue

color match {
  case Blue => println("it's blue!")
  case Other(x) => println(s"it's $x!")
}
```

# Destructuring

Destructuring allows us to query inner parts of an ADT

```tut:silent
sealed trait Vehicle
case class Car(
  brand: String, model: String, color: Color
) extends Vehicle
case class Plane(
  brand: String, model: String, wingSpan: Int
) extends Vehicle
```

# Destructuring

```tut:silent
val vehicle: Vehicle = Car("Honda", "Accord", Red)
```

# Destructuring

```tut:silent
vehicle match {
  case Car(brand, model, Red) =>
    s"it's a red $brand $model"
  case Car(brand, model, Blue) =>
    s"it's a red $brand $model"
  case Car(brand, model, Other(colorName)) =>
    s"it's a $colorName $brand $model"
  case Plane(brand, model, wingSpan) =>
    s"it's a $brand $model with $wingSpan meter of wing span!"
}
```

# Guards

Guards are boolean conditions we want to check while pattern matching.

```tut:silent
val plane: Vehicle = Plane("Boeing", "747", 47)

plane match {
  case Plane(brand, model, wingSpan) if wingSpan > 40 =>
    s"it's a big $brand $model"
  case Plane(brand, model, wingSpan) if wingSpan <= 40 =>
    s"it's a small $brand $model"
  case _ => s"it's not a plane..."
}
```

# Recursion

Recursion happens when a function calls itself.  It's the solution we
use in functional programming to the problems for which OOP uses
loops.

> Notice: we will not deal with tail recursion in this section

# Recursion

## Fibonacci sequence

Fibonacci sequence is an infinite in which every number is defined by
summing the two previous numbers.

# Recursion

## Fibonacci in Python (strawman :D)

```python
def fib(num):
    a, b, temp = (1, 0, 0)
    while(num >= 0):
        temp = a
        a = a+b
        b = temp
        num = num - 1
    return b
```

# Recursion

## Fibonacci in Scala

```tut:silent
def fib(num: Int): Int = num match {
  case 0 => 1
  case 1 => 1
  case x => fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2)
}
```

# Recursion

Recursion is tightly coupled to pattern matching and algebraic data
types.

# Recursion

Let's declare a linked list in scala.

```tut:silent
sealed trait List[A]
case class Empty[A]() extends List[A]
case class NonEmpty[A](
  head: A,
  tail: List[A]
) extends List[A]
```

# Recursion

This is how we could create instances of this list.

```tut:silent
val three = NonEmpty(
  1,
  NonEmpty(
    2,
    NonEmpty(
      3,
      Empty())))
```

# Recursion

## length

```tut:silent
def length[A](l: List[A]): Int =
  l match {
    case Empty() => 0
    case NonEmpty(x, xs) => 1 + length(xs)
  }

length(three)
```

# Recursion

## sum

```tut:silent
def sum(list: List[Int]): Int =
  list match {
    case Empty() => 0
    case NonEmpty(x, xs) => x + sum(xs)
  }
```

  case Empty() => Empty()
  case Node(l, x, r) => Node(
    toStringNodes(l),
	x.toString,
	toStringNodes(r))
}
```

# Exercise 2.6

Create a function that squares all elements in an Int tree

## Solution

```tut:silent
def squared(tree: Tree[Int]): Tree[Int] = tree match {
  case Empty() => Empty()
  case Node(l, x, r) => Node(
    squared(l),
	x * x,
	squared(r))
}
```

# Postscript: variance

Scala allows us to express the variance of generic types.  They can
either be invariant (all the generics we've seen are invariant),
covariant, or contravariant.

# Postscript: variance

## Covariance

We express Covariance adding a `+` sign before the generic parameter name.

# Postscript: variance

## Covariance

Let `List` be a type constructor declared as:

```tut:silent
trait List[+A]
```

If we have two types `Foo` and `Bar`,and `Foo` is a subtype of `Bar`,
since `List` is covariant, `List[Foo]` is a subtype of `List[Bar]`.

# Postscript: variance

## Contravariance

Contravariance is similar to covariance, but the inverse.  If we
declare a type constructor as contravariant:

```tut:silent
trait Logger[-A]
```

We mean that, for two types `Foo` and `Bar` if `Foo` is a subtype of
`Bar`, then `List[Bar]` is a subtype of `List[Foo]`

# Postscript: variance

## Contravariance

```tut:silent
class Vehicle
class Car extends Vehicle

def carLogger: Logger[Car] = null
def vehicleLogger: Logger[Vehicle] = null

def logCar(logger: Logger[Car]) = null

logCar(carLogger)
logCar(vehicleLogger)
```

# Postscript: variance

As a final note, try to be very careful of when you use variance.  It
might get out of hand quickly, and when you get to the functional
libraries such as cats or scalaz, it's difficult to make it fit.
